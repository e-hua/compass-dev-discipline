    <h1>Welcome to the internal discipline of the Compass Devs !</h1>

    <p>
      I will be showing you some recommended tools we will be using throughout
      the orbital journey in the following paragraphs !
    </p>

    <h2>1. Git commit</h2>
    <p>
      All the git commit -m command should be followed by meaningful messages,
      specifically, as shown in the link below
    </p>
    <a href="https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html"
      >View git conventions in details</a
    >

    <h2>2. Unified IDEs to avoid environmental inconsistency</h2>
    <p>
      (I know using two IDEs is confusing, but they are the conventions in the
      industry, and by doing so saves you a lotta time from configuring neovim
      plugins like I did :P )
    </p>

    <h3>Frontend: VSCode</h3>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">
      Download the greatest thing MS ever done to mankind
    </a>
    <p>
      Code is definitely the undisputed goat of web programming, not only due to
      its rich extension ecosystem, but also due to its seamless integration
      with modern web development workflows.
